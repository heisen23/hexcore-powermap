# hexcore-powermap
Visualization of hexagonal reactor core power distributions with labeled assemblies and gradient mapping.

This tool reads assembly-wise power values from CSV files, maps them onto a hexagonal grid, and generates a **core power distribution plot** with numerical labels and a color gradient. A colorbar legend is included for reference.
